# HelloTF for JS

To start with Javascript, you just need a single package available through CDN. Although it available through NPN package as well but it is easier to use CDN for working with browser.

Add below script tag to your html file.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.10.0"> </script>
```

That's it, Now you can test Tensor feature like training, re-training and coverting existing model into javascript compatible, right into your browser.

To test, you can use following code.

[HelloTF.js](HelloTF.js)

This is a basic Linear Regression model trained with Mean Square Error and Gradient Descent.
